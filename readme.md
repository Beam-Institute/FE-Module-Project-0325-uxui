# Front end module project

## Goal: 

The goal of this project is: 
- use all your html, css and javaScript skills to build a web site. 
- to create a project to showcase your frontend skills.

## Instructions

- Use your figma designs selected for this project as your mock up.
- Select which pages to focus on (max 3 pages) and prioritize which one to start with.
- Create the files you need (e.g. `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`)
- Prioritise which features are most important and work on these first.
- Work with git and commit frequently (e.g. after each feature)
- Reach out to the trainer if you have questions or need support!

## Expected outcome

- At least one page built using html and css 
- Content that is dynamically rendered using JavaScript  (object or array of data)
- At least one interactive element (form, button, input field...) that is functional
- A responsive layout (if present in the mockup) 


## Optional

- Deploy your project to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) if you want to be able to share it online (on your cv etc.)
- Create a [readme](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/) of the project containing screen shots of the project and a project description. Include images of the mockups you used. If you don't publish your site, also include some screen shots of the web page in the readme file.  Here you can learn how to write [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).
